# TeachX-Georgia-Standards
This project contributes to a web application that makes it easier for teachers to find material that helps students meet Georgia's educational standards.

The first part of the project involves converting the PDFs that contain the standards into text documents, then structuring the text into CSVs. The CSVs will eventually go into a database the the web application will extract data from.

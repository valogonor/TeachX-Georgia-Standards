              "'Science Georgia Standards of Excellence\\n\\nPhysical Science Standards\\nThe Science Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to provide foundational knowledge\\nand skills for all students to develop proficiency in science. The Project 2061’s Benchmarks for\\nScience Literacy and the follow up work, A Framework for K-12 Science Education were used as\\nthe core of the standards to determine appropriate content and process skills for students. The\\nScience Georgia Standards of Excellence focus on a limited number of core disciplinary ideas\\nand crosscutting concepts which build from Kindergarten to high school. The standards are\\nwritten with the core knowledge to be mastered integrated with the science and engineering\\npractices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. Crosscutting concepts\\nare used to make connections across different science disciplines.\\nThe Science Georgia Standards of Excellence drive instruction. Hands-on, student-centered, and\\ninquiry-based approaches should be the emphasis of instruction. The standards are a required\\nminimum set of expectations that show proficiency in science. However, instruction can extend\\nbeyond these minimum expectations to meet student needs. At the same time, these standards set\\na maximum expectation on what will be assessed by the Georgia Milestones Assessment System.\\nScience consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge\\nabout the natural world. To become literate in science, students need to possess sufficient\\nunderstanding of fundamental science content knowledge, the ability to engage in the science\\nand engineering practices, and to use scientific and technological information correctly.\\nTechnology should be infused into the curriculum and the safety of the student should always be\\nforemost in instruction.\\nThe Physical Science Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to continue student\\ninvestigations of the physical sciences that began in grades K-8, and provide students the\\nnecessary skills to have a richer knowledge base in physical science. The standards in this course\\nare designed as a survey of the core ideas in the physical sciences. Those core ideas will be\\nstudied in more depth during in the chemistry and physics courses. The physical science\\nstandards include abstract concepts such as the conceptualization of the structure of atoms and\\nthe role they play in determining the properties of materials, motion and forces, the conservation\\nof energy and matter, wave behavior, electricity, and the relationship between electricity and\\nmagnetism. The idea of radioactive decay is limited to the understanding of whole half-lives and\\nhow a constant proportional rate of decay is consistent with declining measures that only\\ngradually approach to zero. Students investigate physical science concepts through the study of\\nphenomena, experiences in laboratory settings, and field work.\\n\\nGeorgia Department of Education\\nMarch 31, 2016 ● Page 1 of 5\\n\\n\\x0cScience Georgia Standards of Excellence\\n\\nPhysical Science\\nSPS1.

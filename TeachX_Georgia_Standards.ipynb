        "\"Science Georgia Standards of Excellence\\n\\nBiology Standards\\nThe Science Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to provide foundational knowledge\\nand skills for all students to develop proficiency in science. The Project 2061’s Benchmarks for\\nScience Literacy and the follow up work, A Framework for K-12 Science Education were used as\\nthe core of the standards to determine appropriate content and process skills for students. The\\nScience Georgia Standards of Excellence focus on a limited number of core disciplinary ideas\\nand crosscutting concepts which build from Kindergarten to high school. The standards are\\nwritten with the core knowledge to be mastered integrated with the science and engineering\\npractices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. Crosscutting concepts\\nare used to make connections across different science disciplines.\\nThe Science Georgia Standards of Excellence drive instruction. Hands-on, student-centered, and\\ninquiry-based approaches should be the emphasis of instruction. The standards are a required\\nminimum set of expectations that show proficiency in science. However, instruction can extend\\nbeyond these minimum expectations to meet student needs. At the same time, these standards set\\na maximum expectation on what will be assessed by the Georgia Milestones Assessment System.\\nScience consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge\\nabout the natural world. To become literate in science, students need to possess sufficient\\nunderstanding of fundamental science content knowledge, the ability to engage in the science\\nand engineering practices, and to use scientific and technological information correctly.\\nTechnology should be infused into the curriculum and the safety of the student should always be\\nforemost in instruction.\\nThe Biology Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to continue the student investigations\\nof the life sciences that began in grades K-8 and provide students the necessary skills to be\\nproficient in biology by focusing on the identification of patterns, processes, and relationships of\\nliving organisms. These standards include more abstract concepts such as the interdependence of\\norganisms, the relationship of matter, energy, and organization in living systems, the behavior of\\norganisms, and biological evolution. Students investigate biological concepts through\\nexperiences in laboratories and field work using the process of inquiry.\\nBiology students start by developing an understanding of the cellular structure and the role these\\nstructures play in living cells. The students develop a fundamental understanding of the role of\\nbio-macromolecules, their structure and function as related to life processes. The students then\\nanalyze how genetic information is passed to their offspring and how these mechanisms lead to\\nvariability and hence diversity of species. They use cladograms and phylogenetic trees to\\ndetermine relationships among major groups of organisms. Biology students are able to\\nrecognize the central role the theory of evolution plays in explaining how the diversity observed\\nwithin species has led to the diversity of life across species through a process of descent with\\nadaptive modification.\\n\\nGeorgia Department of Education\\nMarch 31, 2016 ● Page 1 of 4\\n\\n\\x0cScience Georgia Standards of Excellence\\n\\nBiology\\nSB1.

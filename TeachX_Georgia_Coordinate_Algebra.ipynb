There is a shift toward applying mathematical concepts and skills in the\\ncontext of authentic problems and student understanding of concepts rather than merely following a sequence of\\nprocedures. In mathematics classrooms, students will learn to think critically in a mathematical way with an\\nunderstanding that there are many different solution pathways and sometimes more than one right answer in\\napplied mathematics.

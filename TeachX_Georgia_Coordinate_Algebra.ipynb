There is a shift toward applying mathematical concepts and skills in the\\ncontext of authentic problems and student understanding of concepts rather than merely following a sequence of\\nprocedures. In mathematics classrooms, students will learn to think critically in a mathematical way with an\\nunderstanding that there are many different solution pathways and sometimes more than one right answer in\\napplied mathematics. Mathematics is the economy of information. The central idea of all mathematics is to\\ndiscover how knowing some things leads, via reasoning, to knowing more—without having to commit the\\ninformation to memory as a separate fact. It is the reasoned, logical connections that make mathematics\\ncoherent. The implementation of the Georgia Standards of Excellence in Mathematics places the expected\\nemphasis on sense-making, problem solving, reasoning, representation, modeling, representation, connections,\\nand communication.\\n\\nCoordinate Algebra\\nCoordinate Algebra is the first in a sequence of three high school courses designed to ensure career and college\\nreadiness. The course represents a discrete study of algebra with correlated statistics applications and a bridge to\\nthe second course through coordinate geometric topics.\\nThe standards in the three-course high school sequence specify the mathematics that all students should study in\\norder to be college and career ready. Additional mathematics content is provided in fourth credit courses and\\nadvanced courses including pre-calculus, calculus, advanced statistics, discrete mathematics, and mathematics\\nof finance courses. High school course content standards are listed by conceptual categories including Number\\nand Quantity, Algebra, Functions, Geometry, and Statistics and Probability. Conceptual categories portray a\\ncoherent view of high school mathematics content; a student’s work with functions, for example, crosses a\\nnumber of traditional course boundaries, potentially up through and including calculus. Standards for\\nMathematical Practice provide the foundation for instruction and assessment.\\n\\nMathematics | Standards for Mathematical Practice\\nMathematical Practices are listed with each grade’s mathematical content standards to reflect the\\nneed to connect the mathematical practices to mathematical content in instruction.\\nThe Standards for Mathematical Practice describe varieties of expertise that mathematics educators at all levels\\nshould seek to develop in their students. These practices rest on important “processes and proficiencies” with\\nlongstanding importance in mathematics education. The first of these are the NCTM process standards of\\nproblem solving, reasoning and proof, communication, representation, and connections. The second are the\\nstrands of mathematical proficiency specified in the National Research Council’s report Adding It Up: adaptive\\nreasoning, strategic competence, conceptual understanding (comprehension of mathematical concepts,\\noperations and relations), procedural fluency (skill in carrying out procedures flexibly, accurately, efficiently\\n\\nRichard Woods, State School Superintendent\\nJuly 2016 • Page 2 of 10\\nAll Rights Reserved\\n\\n\\x0cGeorgia Department of Education\\n\\nand appropriately), and productive disposition (habitual inclination to see mathematics as sensible, useful, and\\nworthwhile, coupled with a belief in diligence and one’s own efficacy).\\n1 Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.\\nHigh school students start to examine problems by explaining to themselves the meaning of a problem and\\nlooking for entry points to its solution. They analyze givens, constraints, relationships, and goals. They make\\nconjectures about the form and meaning of the solution and plan a solution pathway rather than simply jumping\\ninto a solution attempt. They consider analogous problems, and try special cases and simpler forms of the\\noriginal problem in order to gain insight into its solution. They monitor and evaluate their progress and change\\ncourse if necessary. Older students might, depending on the context of the problem, transform algebraic\\nexpressions or change the viewing window on their graphing calculator to get the information they need. By\\nhigh school, students can explain correspondences between equations, verbal descriptions, tables, and graphs or\\ndraw diagrams of important features and relationships, graph data, and search for regularity or trends. They\\ncheck their answers to problems using different methods and continually ask themselves, “Does this make\\nsense?” They can understand the approaches of others to solving complex problems and identify\\ncorrespondences between different approaches.\\n2 Reason abstractly and quantitatively.\\nHigh school students seek to make sense of quantities and their relationships in problem situations. They\\nabstract a given situation and represent it symbolically, manipulate the representing symbols, and pause as\\nneeded during the manipulation process in order to probe into the referents for the symbols involved. Students\\nuse quantitative reasoning to create coherent representations of the problem at hand; consider the units involved;\\nattend to the meaning of quantities, not just how to compute them; and know and flexibly use different\\nproperties of operations and objects.\\n3 Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.\\nHigh school students understand and use stated assumptions, definitions, and previously established results in\\nconstructing arguments. They make conjectures and build a logical progression of statements to explore the truth\\nof their conjectures. They are able to analyze situations by breaking them into cases, and can recognize and use\\ncounterexamples. They justify their conclusions, communicate them to others, and respond to the arguments of\\nothers. They reason inductively about data, making plausible arguments that take into account the context from\\nwhich the data arose. High school students are also able to compare the effectiveness of two plausible\\narguments, distinguish correct logic or reasoning from that which is flawed, and—if there is a flaw in an\\nargument—explain what it is. High school students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies,\\nlisten or read the arguments of others, decide whether they make sense, and ask useful questions to clarify or\\nimprove the arguments.\\n4 Model with mathematics.\\nHigh school students can apply the mathematics they know to solve problems arising in everyday life, society,\\nand the workplace. By high school, a student might use geometry to solve a design problem or use a function to\\ndescribe how one quantity of interest depends on another. High school students making assumptions and\\napproximations to simplify a complicated situation, realizing that these may need revision later. They are able to\\nidentify important quantities in a practical situation and map their relationships using such tools as diagrams,\\ntwo-way tables, graphs, flowcharts and formulas. They can analyze those relationships mathematically to draw\\n\\nRichard Woods, State School Superintendent\\nJuly 2016 • Page 3 of 10\\nAll Rights Reserved\\n\\n\\x0cGeorgia Department of Education\\n\\nconclusions. They routinely interpret their mathematical results in the context of the situation and reflect on\\nwhether the results make sense, possibly improving the model if it has not served its purpose.\\n5 Use appropriate tools strategically.\\nHigh school students consider the available tools when solving a mathematical problem. These tools might\\ninclude pencil and paper, concrete models, a ruler, a protractor, a calculator, a spreadsheet, a computer algebra\\nsystem, a statistical package, or dynamic geometry software. High school students should be sufficiently\\nfamiliar with tools appropriate for their grade or course to make sound decisions about when each of these tools\\nmight be helpful, recognizing both the insight to be gained and their limitations. For example, high school\\nstudents analyze graphs of functions and solutions generated using a graphing calculator. They detect possible\\nerrors by strategically using estimation and other mathematical knowledge. When making mathematical models,\\nthey know that technology can enable them to visualize the results of varying assumptions, explore\\nconsequences, and compare predictions with data. They are able to identify relevant external mathematical\\nresources, such as digital content located on a website, and use them to pose or solve problems. They are able to\\nuse technological tools to explore and deepen their understanding of concepts.\\n6 Attend to precision. High school students try to communicate precisely to others by using clear definitions in\\ndiscussion with others and in their own reasoning. They state the meaning of the symbols they choose,\\nspecifying units of measure, and labeling axes to clarify the correspondence with quantities in a problem. They\\ncalculate accurately and efficiently, express numerical answers with a degree of precision appropriate for the\\nproblem context. By the time they reach high school they have learned to examine claims and make explicit use\\nof definitions.\\n7 Look for and make use of structure. By high school, students look closely to discern a pattern or structure.\\nIn the expression x2 + 9x + 14, older students can see the 14 as 2 × 7 and the 9 as 2 + 7. They recognize the\\nsignificance of an existing line in a geometric figure and can use the strategy of drawing an auxiliary line for\\nsolving problems. They also can step back for an overview and shift perspective. They can see complicated\\nthings, such as some algebraic expressions, as single objects or as being composed of several objects. For\\nexample, they can see 5 – 3(x – y)2 as 5 minus a positive number times a square and use that to realize that its\\nvalue cannot be more than 5 for any real numbers x and y. High school students use these patterns to create\\nequivalent expressions, factor and solve equations, and compose functions, and transform figures.\\n8 Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.\\nHigh school students notice if calculations are repeated, and look both for general methods and for shortcuts.\\nNoticing the regularity in the way terms cancel when expanding (x – 1)(x + 1), (x – 1)(x2 + x + 1), and (x – 1)(x3\\n+ x2 + x + 1) might lead them to the general formula for the sum of a geometric series. As they work to solve a\\nproblem, derive formulas or make generalizations, high school students maintain oversight of the process, while\\nattending to the details. They continually evaluate the reasonableness of their intermediate results.\\nConnecting the Standards for Mathematical Practice to the Standards for Mathematical Content\\nThe Standards for Mathematical Practice describe ways in which developing student practitioners of the\\ndiscipline of mathematics should engage with the subject matter as they grow in mathematical maturity and\\nexpertise throughout the elementary, middle and high school years. Designers of curricula, assessments, and\\n\\nRichard Woods, State School Superintendent\\nJuly 2016 • Page 4 of 10\\nAll Rights Reserved\\n\\n\\x0cGeorgia Department of Education\\n\\nprofessional development should all attend to the need to connect the mathematical practices to mathematical\\ncontent in mathematics instruction.\\nThe Standards for Mathematical Content are a balanced combination of procedure and understanding.\\nExpectations that begin with the word “understand” are often especially good opportunities to connect the\\npractices to the content. Students who do not have an understanding of a topic may rely on procedures too\\nheavily. Without a flexible base from which to work, they may be less likely to consider analogous problems,\\nrepresent problems coherently, justify conclusions, apply the mathematics to practical situations, use technology\\nmindfully to work with the mathematics, explain the mathematics accurately to other students, step back for an\\noverview, or deviate from a known procedure to find a shortcut. In short, a lack of understanding effectively\\nprevents a student from engaging in the mathematical practices.\\nIn this respect, those content standards which set an expectation of understanding are potential “points of\\nintersection” between the Standards for Mathematical Content and the Standards for Mathematical Practice.\\nThese points of intersection are intended to be weighted toward central and generative concepts in the school\\nmathematics curriculum that most merit the time, resources, innovative energies, and focus necessary to\\nqualitatively improve the curriculum, instruction, assessment, professional development, and student\\nachievement in mathematics.\\n\\nCoordinate Algebra | Content Standards\\nQuantities\\n\\nN.Q\\n\\nReason quantitatively and use units to solve problems.\\nMGSE9-12.N.Q.1 Use units of measure (linear, area, capacity, rates, and time) as a way to understand\\nproblems:\\na. Identify, use, and record appropriate units of measure within context, within data displays, and on\\ngraphs;\\nb. Convert units and rates using dimensional analysis (English-to-English and Metric-to-Metric without\\nconversion factor provided and between English and Metric with conversion factor);\\nc. Use units within multi-step problems and formulas; interpret units of input and resulting units of output.\\nMGSE9-12.N.Q.2 Define appropriate quantities for the purpose of descriptive modeling. Given a situation,\\ncontext, or problem, students will determine, identify, and use appropriate quantities for representing the\\nsituation.\\nMGSE9-12.N.Q.3 Choose a level of accuracy appropriate to limitations on measurement when reporting\\nquantities. For example, money situations are generally reported to the nearest cent (hundredth). Also, an\\nanswers’ precision is limited to the precision of the data given.\\n\\nSeeing Structure in Expressions\\n\\nA.SSE\\n\\nInterpret the structure of expressions\\nMGSE9-12.A.SSE.1 Interpret expressions that represent a quantity in terms of its context.\\nMGSE9-12.A.SSE.1a Interpret parts of an expression, such as terms, factors, and coefficients, in context.\\n\\nRichard Woods, State School Superintendent\\nJuly 2016 • Page 5 of 10\\nAll Rights Reserved\\n\\n\\x0cGeorgia Department of Education\\n\\nMGSE9-12.A.SSE.1b Given situations which utilize formulas or expressions with multiple terms and/or\\nfactors, interpret the meaning (in context) of individual terms or factors.\\nCreating Equations\\n\\nA.CED\\n\\nCreate equations that describe numbers or relationships\\nMGSE9-12.A.CED.1 Create equations and inequalities in one variable and use them to solve problems. Include\\nequations arising from linear, quadratic, simple rational, and exponential functions (integer inputs only).\\nMGSE9-12.A.CED.2 Create linear, quadratic, and exponential equations in two or more variables to represent\\nrelationships between quantities; graph equations on coordinate axes with labels and scales. (The phrase “in two\\nor more variables” refers to formulas like the compound interest formula, in which A = P(1 + r/n)nt has multiple\\nvariables.)\\nMGSE9-12.A.CED.3 Represent constraints by equations or inequalities, and by systems of equations and/or\\ninequalities, and interpret data points as possible (i.e. a solution) or not possible (i.e. a non-solution) under the\\nestablished constraints.\\nMGSE9-12.A.CED.4 Rearrange formulas to highlight a quantity of interest using the same reasoning as in\\nsolving equations. Examples: Rearrange Ohm’s law V = IR to highlight resistance R; Rearrange area of a\\ncircle formula A = π r2 to highlight the radius r.\\nReasoning with Equations and Inequalities\\n\\nA.REI\\n\\nUnderstand solving equations as a process of reasoning and explain the reasoning\\nMGSE9-12.A.REI.1 Using algebraic properties and the properties of real numbers, justify the steps of a simple,\\none-solution equation.

If f is a function, x is the input (an element of the domain), and f(x) is\\nthe output (an element of the range). Graphically, the graph is y = f(x).\\nMGSE9-12.F.IF.2 Use function notation, evaluate functions for inputs in their domains, and interpret\\nstatements that use function notation in terms of a context.\\nMGSE9-12.F.IF.3 Recognize that sequences are functions, sometimes defined recursively, whose domain is a\\nsubset of the integers. (Generally, the scope of high school math defines this subset as the set of natural\\nnumbers 1,2,3,4...) By graphing or calculating terms, students should be able to show how the recursive\\nsequence a1=7, an=an-1 +2; the sequence sn = 2(n-1) + 7; and the function f(x) = 2x + 5 (when x is a natural\\nnumber) all define the same sequence.\\nInterpret functions that arise in applications in terms of the context\\nMGSE9-12.F.IF.4 Using tables, graphs, and verbal descriptions, interpret the key characteristics of a function\\nwhich models the relationship between two quantities. Sketch a graph showing key features including:\\nintercepts; interval where the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative maximums and\\nminimums; symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity.\\nMGSE9-12.F.IF.5 Relate the domain of a function to its graph and, where applicable, to the quantitative\\nrelationship it describes. For example, if the function h(n) gives the number of person-hours it takes to assemble\\nn engines in a factory, then the positive integers would be an appropriate domain for the function.\\nMGSE9-12.F.IF.6 Calculate and interpret the average rate of change of a function (presented symbolically or as\\na table) over a specified interval. Estimate the rate of change from a graph.\\nAnalyze functions using different representations\\nMGSE9-12.F.IF.7 Graph functions expressed algebraically and show key features of the graph both by hand\\nand by using technology.\\nMGSE9-12.F.IF.7a Graph linear and quadratic functions and show intercepts, maxima, and minima (as\\ndetermined by the function or by context).\\nMGSE9-12.F.IF.7e Graph exponential and logarithmic functions, showing intercepts and end behavior, and\\ntrigonometric functions, showing period, midline, and amplitude.\\n\\nRichard Woods, State School Superintendent\\nJuly 2016 • Page 7 of 10\\nAll Rights Reserved\\n\\n\\x0cGeorgia Department of Education\\n\\nMGSE9-12.F.IF.9 Compare properties of two functions each represented in a different way (algebraically,\\ngraphically, numerically in tables, or by verbal descriptions).

For example, if Jimmy starts out with $15 and earns $2 a day, the explicit expression “2x+15” can\\nbe described recursively (either in writing or verbally) as “to find out how much money Jimmy will have\\ntomorrow, you add $2 to his total today.” J n = J n −1 + 2, J 0 = 15\\nMGSE9-12.F.BF.2 Write arithmetic and geometric sequences recursively and explicitly, use them to model\\nsituations, and translate between the two forms.

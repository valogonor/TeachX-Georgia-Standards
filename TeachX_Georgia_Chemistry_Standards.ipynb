              "'Science Georgia Standards of Excellence\\n\\nChemistry Standards\\nThe Science Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to provide foundational knowledge\\nand skills for all students to develop proficiency in science. The Project 2061’s Benchmarks for\\nScience Literacy and the follow up work, A Framework for K-12 Science Education were used as\\nthe core of the standards to determine appropriate content and process skills for students. The\\nScience Georgia Standards of Excellence focus on a limited number of core disciplinary ideas\\nand crosscutting concepts which build from Kindergarten to high school. The standards are\\nwritten with the core knowledge to be mastered integrated with the science and engineering\\npractices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. Crosscutting concepts\\nare used to make connections across different science disciplines.\\nThe Science Georgia Standards of Excellence drive instruction. Hands-on, student-centered, and\\ninquiry-based approaches should be the emphasis of instruction. The standards are a required\\nminimum set of expectations that show proficiency in science. However, instruction can extend\\nbeyond these minimum expectations to meet student needs. At the same time, these standards set\\na maximum expectation on what will be assessed by the Georgia Milestones Assessment System.\\nScience consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge\\nabout the natural world. To become literate in science, students need to possess sufficient\\nunderstanding of fundamental science content knowledge, the ability to engage in the science\\nand engineering practices, and to use scientific and technological information correctly.\\nTechnology should be infused into the curriculum and the safety of the student should always be\\nforemost in instruction.\\nThe Chemistry Georgia Standards of Excellence are designed to continue student investigations\\nof the physical sciences that began in grades K-8 and provide students the necessary skills to be\\nproficient in chemistry. These standards include more abstract concepts such as the structure of\\natoms, structure and properties of matter, the conservation and interaction of energy and matter,\\nand the use of Kinetic Molecular Theory to model atomic and molecular motion in chemical and\\nphysical processes. Students investigate chemistry concepts through experiences in laboratories\\nand field work using the process of inquiry.\\nChemistry students use the periodic table to help with the identification of elements with\\nparticular properties, recognize patterns that lead to explain chemical reactivity and bond\\nformation. They use the IUPAC nomenclature in order to predict chemical names for ionic\\n(binary and ternary), acidic, and inorganic covalent compounds, and conduct experiments to\\nmanipulate factors that affect chemical reactions.\\n\\nGeorgia Department of Education\\nMarch 31, 2016 ● Page 1 of 4\\n\\n\\x0cScience Georgia Standards of Excellence\\n\\nChemistry\\nSC1.
